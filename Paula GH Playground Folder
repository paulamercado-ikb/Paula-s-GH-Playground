<h2 id=“toc_1">Overview</h2>
<p>
  Apollo offers 4 types of plans: Free, basic, professional, and custom/organization.
  If you want to experience the difference between your free plan and the features
  available in a paid plan, you can experiment for yourself with a free trial.
</p>
<p>There are several advantages of an Apollo free trial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try before you buy!</li>
  <li>
    You know exactly what you’re getting and have full transparency about what
    is and isn’t included in the new plan. This means that if you do choose to
    upgrade when the trial ends, you will have peace of mind from day 1.
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>
      Please note, the record selection limit remains capped at 25 for the
      duration of your free trial. If you choose to upgrade at the end of your
      trial, Apollo unlocks the higher record selection and credit limits,
      according to
      <a href=“https://app.apollo.io/#/settings/plans/upgrade”>the plan</a>
      you choose.
